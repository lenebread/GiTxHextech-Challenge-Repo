This challenge requires you to view source of the HTML pages. There are two ways to complete this.

# First Method

Navigate to the challenge link. We are provided with a site that says to read the description again. Alternatively, we can also view the page source and see that there is a hidden text that links to another page called "why.html".

Once on the "why.html" page, we are given a hint as to how we can obtain the flag.

Viewing the page source again and we are able to see that our flag is hidden on the page.

The flag is: ``HEX{B@s1c_w3B_012siXJv}``

# Second Method

Reading the description, we can see that there is a text called ``why.html``. This can be a hint and we can attempt to navigate to the page called ``why.html``.

Upon navigating to it, we are given a hint as to how we can obtain the flag. We can obtain it by viewing the page source.

The flag is: ``HEX{B@s1c_w3B_012siXJv}``
